# Travel Advisor

This repository contains the source code for Travel Advisor, a web application that helps users discover nearby restaurants, hotels, and attractions.

## How Travel Advisor Works

Travel Advisor is a ReactJS web application that uses the RapidAPI to access data about nearby restaurants, hotels, and attractions. The user can enter their location or allow the web application to access their location automatically. The application then displays a map with markers for nearby places of interest.

The user can filter the results by category, such as restaurants, hotels, or attractions, and view detailed information about each place, such as its address, phone number, and user reviews.

Travel Advisor has been integrated with Firebase, which provides real-time database storage and user authentication.
